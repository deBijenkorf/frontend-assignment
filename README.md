This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Next.js uses [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), which are served at [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api). You can add a new endpoint by creating a file in the folder `pages/api`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
